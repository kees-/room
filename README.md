A static site generator for creating linear, paginated moodboard slide decks from are.na channels.

- Try first to prototype with babashka:
- Get requests from are.na playground.
- Use builtin http requests then get data parse and sanitize.
- Potentially use malli to normalize a schema.
- Create selmer html templates.
- Dispatch data types with a multimethod to create html snippets.
- Work on the CSS.
- Work on the UX to navigate pages.
- Work on a local export.
- Work on a model for deployment.
